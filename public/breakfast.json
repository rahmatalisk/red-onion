        "body":"Bistek Tagalog is a type of Filipino beef stew. This is also known as Beefsteak to some people. It is comprised of thin slices of beef and a generous amount of onions. These are stewed in a soy sauce and lemon juice mixture until the beef gets very tender. It is best enjoyed with warm rice. In my opinion, there is a huge possibility that the term Bistek was derived from the words “beef steak”. I have not done the research yet.
